Users can create different accounts with their respective usernames and profile pictures and interact with each other. These accounts can also be deleted. Information persistence was implemented using local storage, so the browser will remember any changes made. Therefore, a reset button was implemented to restore the comments section to its initial state, which comes from a JSON file. It was developed using React and styled with CSS and Tailwind, with a responsive “mobile first” design. The use of tools such as useState and useContext facilitated the manipulation of states and variables to build a better organized and modular architecture."

It is a simple yet useful application that allows users to calculate their age in years, months, and days. By entering their date of birth, the application automatically performs the calculation and ensures the accuracy of the information through field validation based on regular expressions. To develop the project, technologies such as HTML, CSS, React.js, and TypeScript were used, with the latter being my first approach to its basic and fundamental concepts, such as assigning types to each variable and using interfaces. The application is easy to use and has a responsive design that adapts to any mobile device."
